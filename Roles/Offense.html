<h2>Offense Heroes</h2>
<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/1/14/OffenseIcon.png/revision/latest?cb=20160625040759" alt="Offense Logo">

<p>Offense Heroes are normally used for one thing: <b>DAMAGE!</b> Made to harrass and press for the point, Offense heroes have high mobility to help them get into and out of the fight. Examples of this are Genji's Swift Strike (Ability 2), Tracer's Blinks (Ability 1), and Reaper's Shadow Step (Ability 2).</p>
<p>A disadvantage that most offense heroes suffer from are a lower health pool. None of these heroes have natural armor or shield, so don't be afriad of asking your local Symmetra or Torbj√∂rn for some protection. <strike>Then again, if your Symmetra hasn't given you any shield, she probably doesn't know about her 2nd ability...</strike> </p>
<p>Despite having a lower health pool, most offense heroes have a way to either heal or avoid damage entirely. For example, Reaper's passive allows him to heal when he elimates someone, and his Wraith Form (Ability 1) not only makes him slightly faster, he also cannot take damage and is <span title="CC is short for Crowd Control and refers statuses other heroes can inflict on you, such as slows, stuns, pulls, etc.">CC</span> immune.</p>
